Global TODO
===========

- "often used" combo box in sidebar
- discuss and debug comments system
- navigation links at the bottom too
- write new Makefile, handle automatic version info and checkout
- write a "printable" builder (export to latex, most probably)
- discuss the default role
- discuss lib -> ref section move
- prepare for databases other than sqlite for comments
- look at the old tools/ scripts, what functionality should be rewritten
- add search via Xapian?
- optionally have a contents tree view in the sidebar (AJAX based)?
