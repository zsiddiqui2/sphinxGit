Global TODO
===========

- add OpenSearch
- "seealso" links to external examples, see http://svn.python.org/projects/sandbox/trunk/seealso/ and http://effbot.org/zone/idea-seealso.htm
- "often used" combo box in sidebar
- discuss and debug comments system
- write new Makefile, handle automatic checkout
- write a "printable" builder (export to latex, most probably)
- prepare for databases other than sqlite for comments
- look at the old tools/ scripts, what functionality should be rewritten
- source file cross-references?
- add search via Xapian?
- optionally have a contents tree view in the sidebar (AJAX based)?
