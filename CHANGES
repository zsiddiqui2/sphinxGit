Changes in trunk
================

New features added
------------------

* If the `pygments_style` config value contains a dot it's treated as the
  import path of a custom Pygments style class.
* autodoc detects descriptors properly now

* A new config value, `exclude_dirs`, can be used to exclude whole
  directories from the search for source files.

* The configuration directory (containing ``conf.py``) can now be set
  independently from the source directory.  For that, a new command-line
  option ``-c`` has been added.

* A new directive ``tabularcolumns`` can be used to give a tabular column
  specification for LaTeX output.  Tables now use the ``tabulary`` package.

* A new config value, `latex_use_parts`, can be used to enable parts in LaTeX
  documents.

Bugs fixed
----------

* sphinx.htmlwriter: Correctly write the TOC file for any structure of the
  master document.  Also encode non-ASCII characters as entities in TOC
  and index file.

* Lots of little fixes to the LaTeX output and style.

* Fix OpenSearch template and make template URL absolute.  The
  `html_use_opensearch` config value now must give the base URL.

* Some unused files are now stripped from the HTML help file build.


Release 0.2 (Apr 27, 2008)
==========================

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* Jinja, the template engine used for the default HTML templates, is now
  no longer shipped with Sphinx.  If it is not installed automatically for
  you (it is now listed as a dependency in ``setup.py``), install it manually
  from PyPI.  This will also be needed if you're using Sphinx from a SVN
  checkout; in that case please also remove the ``sphinx/jinja`` directory
  that may be left over from old revisions.

* The clumsy handling of the ``index.html`` template was removed.  The config
  value ``html_index`` is gone, and ``html_additional_pages`` should be used
  instead.  If you need it, the old ``index.html`` template is still there,
  called ``defindex.html``, and you can port your html_index template, using
  Jinja inheritance, by changing your template::

     {% extends "defindex.html" %}
     {% block tables %}
     ... old html_index template content ...
     {% endblock %}

  and putting ``'index': name of your template`` in ``html_additional_pages``.

* In the layout template, redundant ``block``\s were removed; you should use
  Jinja's standard ``{{ super() }}`` mechanism instead, as explained in the
  (newly written) templating docs.

New features added
------------------

* Extension API (Application object):

  - Support a new method, ``add_crossref_type``.  It works like
    ``add_description_unit`` but the directive will only create a target
    and no output.
  - Support a new method, ``add_transform``.  It takes a standard docutils
    ``Transform`` subclass which is then applied by Sphinx' reader on
    parsing reST document trees.
  - Add support for other template engines than Jinja, by adding an
    abstraction called a "template bridge".  This class handles rendering
    of templates and can be changed using the new configuration value
    "template_bridge".
  - The config file itself can be an extension (if it provides a ``setup()``
    function).

* Markup:

  - New directive, ``currentmodule``.  It can be used to indicate the module
    name of the following documented things without creating index entries.
  - Allow giving a different title to documents in the toctree.
  - Allow giving multiple options in a ``cmdoption`` directive.
  - Fix display of class members without explicit class name given.

* Templates (HTML output):

  - ``index.html`` renamed to ``defindex.html``, see above.
  - There's a new config value, ``html_title``, that controls the overall
    "title" of the set of Sphinx docs.  It is used instead everywhere instead of
    "Projectname vX.Y documentation" now.
  - All references to "documentation" in the templates have been removed, so
    that it is now easier to use Sphinx for non-documentation documents with
    the default templates.
  - Templates now have an XHTML doctype, to be consistent with docutils'
    HTML output.
  - You can now create an OpenSearch description file with the
    ``html_use_opensearch`` config value.
  - You can now quickly include a logo in the sidebar, using the ``html_logo``
    config value.
  - There are new blocks in the sidebar, so that you can easily insert content
    into the sidebar.

* LaTeX output:

  - The ``sphinx.sty`` package was cleaned of unused stuff.
  - You can include a logo in the title page with the ``latex_logo`` config
    value.
  - You can define the link colors and a border and background color for
    verbatim environments.

Thanks to Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Talin, Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven and Sebastian
Wiesner for suggestions.

Bugs fixed
----------

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Don't check ``__module__`` for explicitly given
  members.  Remove "self" in class constructor argument list.

* sphinx.htmlwriter: Don't use os.path for joining image HREFs.

* sphinx.htmlwriter: Don't use SmartyPants for HTML attribute values.

* sphinx.latexwriter: Implement option lists.  Also, some other changes
  were made to ``sphinx.sty`` in order to enhance compatibility and
  remove old unused stuff.  Thanks to Gael Varoquaux for that!

* sphinx.roles: Fix referencing glossary terms with explicit targets.

* sphinx.environment: Don't swallow TOC entries when resolving subtrees.

* sphinx.quickstart: Create a sensible default latex_documents setting.

* sphinx.builder, sphinx.environment: Gracefully handle some user error
  cases.

* sphinx.util: Follow symbolic links when searching for documents.


Release 0.1.61950 (Mar 26, 2008)
================================

* sphinx.quickstart: Fix format string for Makefile.


Release 0.1.61945 (Mar 26, 2008)
================================

* sphinx.htmlwriter, sphinx.latexwriter: Support the ``.. image::``
  directive by copying image files to the output directory.

* sphinx.builder: Consistently name "special" HTML output directories
  with a leading underscore; this means ``_sources`` and ``_static``.

* sphinx.environment: Take dependent files into account when collecting
  the set of outdated sources.

* sphinx.directives: Record files included with ``.. literalinclude::``
  as dependencies.

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Record files from which docstrings are included
  as dependencies.

* sphinx.builder: Rebuild all HTML files in case of a template change.

* sphinx.builder: Handle unavailability of TOC relations (previous/
  next chapter) more gracefully in the HTML builder.

* sphinx.latexwriter: Include fncychap.sty which doesn't seem to be
  very common in TeX distributions.  Add a ``clean`` target in the
  latex Makefile.  Really pass the correct paper and size options
  to the LaTeX document class.

* setup: On Python 2.4, don't egg-depend on docutils if a docutils is
  already installed -- else it will be overwritten.


Release 0.1.61843 (Mar 24, 2008)
================================

* sphinx.quickstart: Really don't create a makefile if the user
  doesn't want one.

* setup: Don't install scripts twice, via setuptools entry points
  and distutils scripts.  Only install via entry points.

* sphinx.builder: Don't recognize the HTML builder's copied source
  files (under ``_sources``) as input files if the source suffix is
  ``.txt``.

* sphinx.highlighting: Generate correct markup for LaTeX Verbatim
  environment escapes even if Pygments is not installed.

* sphinx.builder: The WebHTMLBuilder is now called PickleHTMLBuilder.

* sphinx.htmlwriter: Make parsed-literal blocks work as expected,
  not highlighting them via Pygments.

* sphinx.environment: Don't error out on reading an empty source file.


Release 0.1.61798 (Mar 23, 2008)
================================

* sphinx: Work with docutils SVN snapshots as well as 0.4.

* sphinx.ext.doctest: Make the group in which doctest blocks are
  placed selectable, and default to ``'default'``.

* sphinx.ext.doctest: Replace ``<BLANKLINE>`` in doctest blocks by
  real blank lines for presentation output, and remove doctest
  options given inline.

* sphinx.environment: Move doctest_blocks out of block_quotes to
  support indented doctest blocks.

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Render ``.. automodule::`` docstrings in a
  section node, so that module docstrings can contain proper
  sectioning.

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Use the module's encoding for decoding
  docstrings, rather than requiring ASCII.


Release 0.1.61611 (Mar 21, 2008)
================================

* First public release.
