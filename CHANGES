Changes in trunk
================

* sphinx.quickstart: Really don't create a makefile if the user
  doesn't want one.

* setup: Don't install scripts twice, via setuptools entry points
  and distutils scripts.  Only install via entry points.

* sphinx.builder: Don't recognize the HTML builder's copied source
  files (under _sources) as input files if the source suffix is
  ``.txt``.

* sphinx.highlighting: Generate correct markup for LaTeX Verbatim
  environment escapes even if Pygments is not installed.

* sphinx.builder: The WebHTMLBuilder is now called PickleHTMLBuilder.

* sphinx.htmlwriter: Make parsed-literal blocks work as expected,
  not highlighting them via Pygments.


Release 0.1.61798 (Mar 23, 2008)
================================

* sphinx: Work with docutils SVN snapshots as well as 0.4.

* sphinx.ext.doctest: Make the group in which doctest blocks are
  placed selectable, and default to ``'default'``.

* sphinx.ext.doctest: Replace <BLANKLINE> in doctest blocks by
  real blank lines for presentation output, and remove doctest
  options given inline.

* sphinx.environment: Move doctest_blocks out of block_quotes to
  support indented doctest blocks.

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Render .. automodule:: docstrings in a section
  node, so that module docstrings can contain proper sectioning.

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Use the module's encoding for decoding
  docstrings, rather than requiring ASCII.


Release 0.1.61611 (Mar 21, 2008)
