Release 0.5 (in development)
============================

New features added
------------------

* HTML output and templates:

  - Incompatible change: The "root" relation link (top left in the
    relbar) now points to the ``master_doc`` by default, no longer to a
    document called "index".  The old behavior, while useful in some
    situations, was somewhat unexpected.  Override the "rootrellink"
    block in the template to customize where it refers to.

  - The JavaScript search now searches for objects before searching in
    the full text.

  - ``SerializingHTMLBuilder`` was added as new abstract builder that
    can be subclassed to serialize build HTML in a specific format.  The
    ``PickleHTMLBuilder`` is a concrete subclass of it that uses pickle
    as serialization implementation.
  
  - ``JSONHTMLBuilder`` was added as another ``SerializingHTMLBuilder``
    subclass that dumps the generated HTML into JSON files for further
    processing.

  - The ``rellinks`` block in the layout template is now called
    ``linktags`` to avoid confusion with the relbar links.

  - The HTML builders have two additional attributes now that can be
    used to disable the anchor-link creation after headlines and
    definition links.

* New and changed config values:
    
  - Added support for internationalization in generated text with the
    ``language`` and ``locale_dirs`` config values.  Many thanks to
    language contributors:

    * Horst Gutmann -- German
    * Pavel Kosina -- Czech
    * David Larlet -- French
    * MichaÅ‚ Kandulski -- Polish
    * Yasushi Masuda -- Japanese

  - The new config value ``highlight_language`` set a global default for
    highlighting.  When ``'python3'`` is selected, console output blocks
    are recognized like for ``'python'``.

  - Exposed Pygments' lexer guessing as a highlight "language" ``guess``.

  - The new config value ``latex_elements`` allows to override all LaTeX
    snippets that Sphinx puts into the generated .tex file by default.

  - Added ``exclude_dirnames`` config value that can be used to exclude
    e.g. CVS directories from source file search.

* Extensions:

  - The new extensions ``sphinx.ext.jsmath`` and ``sphinx.ext.pngmath``
    provide math support for both HTML and LaTeX builders.

  - The new extension ``sphinx.ext.intersphinx`` half-automatically
    creates links to Sphinx documentation of Python objects in other
    projects.

  - sphinx.doc.autodoc has a new event ``autodoc-process-signature``
    that allows tuning function signature introspection.

  - Respect __all__ when autodocumenting module members.

  - The `automodule` directive now supports the ``synopsis``,
    ``deprecated`` and ``platform`` options.

* Extension API:

  - ``Sphinx.add_node()`` now takes optional visitor methods for the
    HTML, LaTeX and text translators; this prevents having to manually
    patch the classes.

  - Added ``Sphinx.add_javascript()`` that adds scripts to load in the
    default HTML template.

  - Added new events: ``env-updated``, ``missing-reference``,
    ``build-finished``.

* Other changes:
    
  - Added a distutils command `build_sphinx`: When Sphinx is installed,
    you can call ``python setup.py build_sphinx`` for projects that have
    Sphinx documentation, which will build the docs and place them in
    the standard distutils build directory.

  - "System Message" warnings are now automatically removed from the
    built documentation, and only written to stderr.  If you want the
    old behavior, set the new config value ``keep_warnings`` to True.

  - Glossary entries are now automatically added to the index.

  - Figures with captions can now be referred to like section titles,
    using the ``:ref:`` role without an explicit link text.

  - In quickstart, if the selected root path already contains a Sphinx
    project, complain and abort.


Release 0.4.2 (Jul 29, 2008)
============================

* Fix rendering of the ``samp`` role in HTML.

* Fix a bug with LaTeX links to headings leading to a wrong page.

* Reread documents with globbed toctrees when source files are
  added or removed.

* Add a missing parameter to PickleHTMLBuilder.handle_page().

* Put inheritance info always on its own line.

* Don't automatically enclose code with whitespace in it in quotes;
  only do this for the ``samp`` role.

* autodoc now emits a more precise error message when a module
  can't be imported or an attribute can't be found.

* The JavaScript search now uses the correct file name suffix when
  referring to found items.

* The automodule directive now accepts the ``inherited-members``
  and ``show-inheritance`` options again.

* You can now rebuild the docs normally after relocating the source
  and/or doctree directory.


Release 0.4.1 (Jul 5, 2008)
===========================

* Added sub-/superscript node handling to TextBuilder.

* Label names in references are now case-insensitive, since reST
  label names are always lowercased.

* Fix linkcheck builder crash for malformed URLs.

* Add compatibility for admonitions and docutils 0.5.

* Remove the silly restriction on "rubric" in the LaTeX writer: you
  can now write arbitrary "rubric" directives, and only those with
  a title of "Footnotes" will be ignored.

* Copy the HTML logo to the output ``_static`` directory.

* Fix LaTeX code for modules with underscores in names and platforms.

* Fix a crash with nonlocal image URIs.

* Allow the usage of :noindex: in ``automodule`` directives, as
  documented.

* Fix the ``delete()`` docstring processor function in autodoc.

* Fix warning message for nonexisting images.

* Fix JavaScript search in Internet Explorer.


Release 0.4 (Jun 23, 2008)
==========================

New features added
------------------

* ``tocdepth`` can be given as a file-wide metadata entry, and
  specifies the maximum depth of a TOC of this file.

* The new config value `default_role` can be used to select the
  default role for all documents.

* Sphinx now interprets field lists with fields like ``:param foo:``
  in description units.

* The new `staticmethod` directive can be used to mark methods as
  static methods.

* HTML output:

  - The "previous" and "next" links have a more logical structure, so
    that by following "next" links you can traverse the entire TOC
    tree.

  - The new event `html-page-context` can be used to include custom
    values into the context used when rendering an HTML template.

  - Document metadata is now in the default template context, under
    the name `metadata`.

  - The new config value `html_favicon` can be used to set a favicon
    for the HTML output.  Thanks to Sebastian Wiesner.

  - The new config value `html_use_index` can be used to switch index
    generation in HTML documents off.

  - The new config value `html_split_index` can be used to create
    separate index pages for each letter, to be used when the complete
    index is too large for one page.

  - The new config value `html_short_title` can be used to set a
    shorter title for the documentation which is then used in the
    navigation bar.

  - The new config value `html_show_sphinx` can be used to control
    whether a link to Sphinx is added to the HTML footer.

  - The new config value `html_file_suffix` can be used to set the
    HTML file suffix to e.g. ``.xhtml``.

  - The directories in the `html_static_path` can now contain
    subdirectories.

  - The module index now isn't collapsed if the number of submodules
    is larger than the number of toplevel modules.

* The image directive now supports specifying the extension as ``.*``,
  which makes the builder select the one that matches best.  Thanks to
  Sebastian Wiesner.

* The new config value `exclude_trees` can be used to exclude whole
  subtrees from the search for source files.

* Defaults for configuration values can now be callables, which allows
  dynamic defaults.

* The new TextBuilder creates plain-text output.

* Python 3-style signatures, giving a return annotation via ``->``,
  are now supported.

* Extensions:

  - The autodoc extension now offers a much more flexible way to
    manipulate docstrings before including them into the output, via
    the new `autodoc-process-docstring` event.

  - The `autodoc` extension accepts signatures for functions, methods
    and classes now that override the signature got via introspection
    from Python code.

  - The `autodoc` extension now offers a ``show-inheritance`` option
    for autoclass that inserts a list of bases after the signature.

  - The autodoc directives now support the ``noindex`` flag option.


Bugs fixed
----------

* Correctly report the source location for docstrings included with
  autodoc.

* Fix the LaTeX output of description units with multiple signatures.

* Handle the figure directive in LaTeX output.

* Handle raw admonitions in LaTeX output.

* Fix determination of the title in HTML help output.

* Handle project names containing spaces.

* Don't write SSI-like comments in HTML output.

* Rename the "sidebar" class to "sphinxsidebar" in order to stay different
  from reST sidebars.

* Use a binary TOC in HTML help generation to fix issues links without
  explicit anchors.

* Fix behavior of references to functions/methods with an explicit title.

* Support citation, subscript and superscript nodes in LaTeX writer.

* Provide the standard "class" directive as "cssclass"; else it is
  shadowed by the Sphinx-defined directive.

* Fix the handling of explicit module names given to autoclass directives.
  They now show up with the correct module name in the generated docs.

* Enable autodoc to process Unicode docstrings.

* The LaTeX writer now translates line blocks with ``\raggedright``,
  which plays nicer with tables.

* Fix bug with directories in the HTML builder static path.


Release 0.3 (May 6, 2008)
=========================

New features added
------------------

* The ``toctree`` directive now supports a ``glob`` option that allows
  glob-style entries in the content.

* If the `pygments_style` config value contains a dot it's treated as the
  import path of a custom Pygments style class.

* A new config value, `exclude_dirs`, can be used to exclude whole
  directories from the search for source files.

* The configuration directory (containing ``conf.py``) can now be set
  independently from the source directory.  For that, a new command-line
  option ``-c`` has been added.

* A new directive ``tabularcolumns`` can be used to give a tabular column
  specification for LaTeX output.  Tables now use the ``tabulary`` package.
  Literal blocks can now be placed in tables, with several caveats.

* A new config value, `latex_use_parts`, can be used to enable parts in LaTeX
  documents.

* Autodoc now skips inherited members for classes, unless you give the
  new ``inherited-members`` option.

* A new config value, `autoclass_content`, selects if the docstring of the
  class' ``__init__`` method is added to the directive's body.

* Support for C++ class names (in the style ``Class::Function``) in C function
  descriptions.

* Support for a ``toctree_only`` item in items for the ``latex_documents``
  config value.  This only includes the documents referenced by TOC trees in the
  output, not the rest of the file containing the directive.

Bugs fixed
----------

* sphinx.htmlwriter: Correctly write the TOC file for any structure of the
  master document.  Also encode non-ASCII characters as entities in TOC
  and index file.  Remove two remaining instances of hard-coded
  "documentation".

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: descriptors are detected properly now.

* sphinx.latexwriter: implement all reST admonitions, not just ``note``
  and ``warning``.

* Lots of little fixes to the LaTeX output and style.

* Fix OpenSearch template and make template URL absolute.  The
  `html_use_opensearch` config value now must give the base URL.

* Some unused files are now stripped from the HTML help file build.


Release 0.2 (Apr 27, 2008)
==========================

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* Jinja, the template engine used for the default HTML templates, is now
  no longer shipped with Sphinx.  If it is not installed automatically for
  you (it is now listed as a dependency in ``setup.py``), install it manually
  from PyPI.  This will also be needed if you're using Sphinx from a SVN
  checkout; in that case please also remove the ``sphinx/jinja`` directory
  that may be left over from old revisions.

* The clumsy handling of the ``index.html`` template was removed.  The config
  value ``html_index`` is gone, and ``html_additional_pages`` should be used
  instead.  If you need it, the old ``index.html`` template is still there,
  called ``defindex.html``, and you can port your html_index template, using
  Jinja inheritance, by changing your template::

     {% extends "defindex.html" %}
     {% block tables %}
     ... old html_index template content ...
     {% endblock %}

  and putting ``'index': name of your template`` in ``html_additional_pages``.

* In the layout template, redundant ``block``\s were removed; you should use
  Jinja's standard ``{{ super() }}`` mechanism instead, as explained in the
  (newly written) templating docs.

New features added
------------------

* Extension API (Application object):

  - Support a new method, ``add_crossref_type``.  It works like
    ``add_description_unit`` but the directive will only create a target
    and no output.
  - Support a new method, ``add_transform``.  It takes a standard docutils
    ``Transform`` subclass which is then applied by Sphinx' reader on
    parsing reST document trees.
  - Add support for other template engines than Jinja, by adding an
    abstraction called a "template bridge".  This class handles rendering
    of templates and can be changed using the new configuration value
    "template_bridge".
  - The config file itself can be an extension (if it provides a ``setup()``
    function).

* Markup:

  - New directive, ``currentmodule``.  It can be used to indicate the module
    name of the following documented things without creating index entries.
  - Allow giving a different title to documents in the toctree.
  - Allow giving multiple options in a ``cmdoption`` directive.
  - Fix display of class members without explicit class name given.

* Templates (HTML output):

  - ``index.html`` renamed to ``defindex.html``, see above.
  - There's a new config value, ``html_title``, that controls the overall
    "title" of the set of Sphinx docs.  It is used instead everywhere instead of
    "Projectname vX.Y documentation" now.
  - All references to "documentation" in the templates have been removed, so
    that it is now easier to use Sphinx for non-documentation documents with
    the default templates.
  - Templates now have an XHTML doctype, to be consistent with docutils'
    HTML output.
  - You can now create an OpenSearch description file with the
    ``html_use_opensearch`` config value.
  - You can now quickly include a logo in the sidebar, using the ``html_logo``
    config value.
  - There are new blocks in the sidebar, so that you can easily insert content
    into the sidebar.

* LaTeX output:

  - The ``sphinx.sty`` package was cleaned of unused stuff.
  - You can include a logo in the title page with the ``latex_logo`` config
    value.
  - You can define the link colors and a border and background color for
    verbatim environments.

Thanks to Jacob Kaplan-Moss, Talin, Jeroen Ruigrok van der Werven and Sebastian
Wiesner for suggestions.

Bugs fixed
----------

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Don't check ``__module__`` for explicitly given
  members.  Remove "self" in class constructor argument list.

* sphinx.htmlwriter: Don't use os.path for joining image HREFs.

* sphinx.htmlwriter: Don't use SmartyPants for HTML attribute values.

* sphinx.latexwriter: Implement option lists.  Also, some other changes
  were made to ``sphinx.sty`` in order to enhance compatibility and
  remove old unused stuff.  Thanks to Gael Varoquaux for that!

* sphinx.roles: Fix referencing glossary terms with explicit targets.

* sphinx.environment: Don't swallow TOC entries when resolving subtrees.

* sphinx.quickstart: Create a sensible default latex_documents setting.

* sphinx.builder, sphinx.environment: Gracefully handle some user error
  cases.

* sphinx.util: Follow symbolic links when searching for documents.

================================

* sphinx.quickstart: Fix format string for Makefile.


Release 0.1.61945 (Mar 26, 2008)
================================

* sphinx.htmlwriter, sphinx.latexwriter: Support the ``.. image::``
  directive by copying image files to the output directory.

* sphinx.builder: Consistently name "special" HTML output directories
  with a leading underscore; this means ``_sources`` and ``_static``.

* sphinx.environment: Take dependent files into account when collecting
  the set of outdated sources.

* sphinx.builder: Rebuild all HTML files in case of a template change.

* sphinx.builder: Handle unavailability of TOC relations (previous/
  next chapter) more gracefully in the HTML builder.

* sphinx.latexwriter: Include fncychap.sty which doesn't seem to be
  very common in TeX distributions.  Add a ``clean`` target in the
  latex Makefile.  Really pass the correct paper and size options
  to the LaTeX document class.

* setup: On Python 2.4, don't egg-depend on docutils if a docutils is
  already installed -- else it will be overwritten.

================================

* sphinx.quickstart: Really don't create a makefile if the user
  doesn't want one.

* setup: Don't install scripts twice, via setuptools entry points
  and distutils scripts.  Only install via entry points.

* sphinx.builder: Don't recognize the HTML builder's copied source
  files (under ``_sources``) as input files if the source suffix is
  ``.txt``.

* sphinx.highlighting: Generate correct markup for LaTeX Verbatim

* sphinx.ext.doctest: Make the group in which doctest blocks are
  placed selectable, and default to ``'default'``.

* sphinx.ext.doctest: Replace ``<BLANKLINE>`` in doctest blocks by
  real blank lines for presentation output, and remove doctest
  options given inline.

* sphinx.environment: Move doctest_blocks out of block_quotes to
  support indented doctest blocks.

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Render ``.. automodule::`` docstrings in a
  section node, so that module docstrings can contain proper
  sectioning.

* sphinx.ext.autodoc: Use the module's encoding for decoding
  docstrings, rather than requiring ASCII.


Release 0.1.61611 (Mar 21, 2008)
================================

* First public release.
